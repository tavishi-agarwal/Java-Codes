# Java-Codes
This repository contains Java programs and assignments developed as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It includes implementations of core OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, interfaces, and exception handling,  practical exercises and mini-projects to strengthen Java programming skills.
